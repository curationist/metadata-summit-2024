Here you will find the slides and report from the 2024 Curationist Metadata Summit. 

The session took place on September 19th from 11 am to 12:30 pm ET. This online event brought together metadata experts and enthusiasts to advance our vision of providing open access to cultural heritage through a social justice lens.

This year, we focused on the integration of Wikidata -- both as a source of controlled descriptive vocabularies and as a potential template schema for our metadata, which primarily comes from museums. We shared our research evaluating Wikidata and Wikibase as tools to improve Curationist's cultural heritage data in front of a panel of Wiki experts:
Anni Saisto, Pori Art Museum
Ben Vershbow, Wikimedia Foundation
Christos Varvantakis, Wikimedia Deutschland
Evelin Heidel, Curationist board member
Hanno Lans, CopyClear
Sandra Fauconnier, GLAM-Wiki Specialist
